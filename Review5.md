  - Business users should be able to elbow the programmer out to fix the code. It creates a broad user community & makes
    code understandable.
 + What is a context manager?
   - logger: nest function to keep track of the all parsings. This sits on top of any funciton
   - timer: decorator to track the time of the function running.
 + Compartmental models are a visual representation of 1st order linear equation. Justify
  - Compartmentmental modeling has stocks to be estimated by the incoming/outgoing flux and the exisiting stock inventory.
   For ex,  C = C0 + dt(r1+r3-r2)...where r1,r2,r3 are the rates and C0 is existing stock. C is the current stock.

 + Name some python tools that can be used for DSLs.
  - contextmanagers,regex
 + What is an internal DSL?
  - An Internal DSL is written within an host Language. like inside python
 + Write a compartmental model for the diaper example below:
